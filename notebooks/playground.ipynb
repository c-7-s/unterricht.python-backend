       " Document(page_content='Socrates (470 – 399 BCE) employed the Socratic method while engaging with a student or peer. This style\\ndoes not impart know ledge, but rather tries to strengthen the logic of the student by revealing the\\nconclusions of the statement of the student as erroneous or suppor ted. The instructor in this learning\\nenvironment recognizes the learners\\' need to think for themselves to facilitate their ability to think about\\nproblems and issues.[20] It was first described by P lato in the Socratic Dialogue s.\\nPlato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE) describes a system of education in The Republic (375 BCE) in\\nwhich individual and family rights are sacrificed to the State. He describes three castes: one to learn a trade;\\none to learn literary and aesthetic ideas; and one to be trained in literary, aesthetic, scientific, and\\nphilosophical ideas.[21] Plato saw education as a fulfillment of the soul, and by fulfilling the soul the body\\nsubsequently benefited. Plato viewed phys ical education for all as a necessity to a stable society.[21]\\nAristotle (384–322 BCE) composed a treatise, On Education, which was subsequently lost. However, he\\nrenounc ed Plato\\'s view in subsequent works, advoc ating for a common education mandated to all citizens\\nby the State. A small minority of people residing within Greek city-states at this time were considered\\ncitizens, and thus Aristotle still limited education to a minority within Greece. Aristotle advoc ates physical\\neducation should precede intellectual studies.[21]\\nMarcus Fabius Quintilianus (35 – 100 CE) published his pedagogy in Institutio Oratoria (95 CE). He\\ndescribes education as a gradual affair, and places certain responsibilities on the teacher. He advoc ates for\\nrhetorical, grammatical, scientific, and phi losophical education.[21]\\nQuintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus (155 – 240 CE) was a Christian scholar who rejected all pagan\\neducation, insisting this was \"a road to the false and arrogant wisdom of ancient philosophe rs\".[21]\\nSaint Jerome (347 – 30 September 420 CE), or Saint Hieronym us, was a Christian scholar who detailed his\\npedagogy of girls in numerous letters throughout  his life. He did not believe the body in need of training,\\nand thus advoc ated for fasting and mortification to subdue  the body .[21] He only recommends the Bible as\\nreading material, with limited expos ure, and cautions against musical instruments. He advoc ates against\\nletting girls interact with society, and of having \"affections for one of her companions than for others.\"[21]\\nHe does recommend teaching the alphabet by ivory blocks instead of memorization so \"She will thus learn\\nby playing.\"[21] He is an advoc ate of positive reinforcement, stating \"Do not chide her for the difficulty she\\nmay have in learning. O n the contrary, encourage her by c ommendation...\"[21]Plato\\nAristotle\\nQuintilian\\nTertullian\\nJerome\\nJean Gerson', metadata={'page': 2, 'source': 'docs/Pedagogy.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Woman teaching geometry (detail of a XIV-\\ncentury illuminated manuscript, at the\\nbeginning of Euclid\\'s Elementa, in the\\ntranslation attributed to Adelard of Bath)Pedagogy\\nPedagogy  (/ ˈp ɛd ə ɡ ɒd ʒi, - ɡo ʊd ʒi, - ɡ ɒ ɡi/), from Ancient\\nGreek παιδαγωγία (paidagōgía), most commonly unde rstood\\nas the approach to teaching, is the theory and practice of\\nlearning, and how this process influences, and is influenced\\nby, the social, political and psychological development of\\nlearners. Pedagogy , taken as an academic discipline, is the\\nstudy of how know ledge and skills are imparted in an\\neducational context, and it considers the interactions that take\\nplace during learning. Both the theory and practice of\\npedagogy vary greatly as they reflect different social,\\npolitical, and cultural contexts.[1]\\nPedagogy is often described as the act of teaching.[2] The\\npedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions,\\njudgm ents, and teaching strategies by taking into\\nconsideration theories of learning, understandings of students\\nand their needs, and the backgrounds  and interests of\\nindividual students.[3][4] Its aims may range from furthering\\nliberal education (the general development of human\\npotential) to the narrower specifics of vocational education\\n(the imparting and acquisition of specific skills).\\nConve ntional western pedagogies view the teacher as\\nknow ledge holder and student as the recipient of know ledge (described by Paulo Freire as \"banking\\nmethods\"[5]), but theories of pedagogy increasingly identify the student as an agent and the teacher as a\\nfacilitator.\\nInstructive strategies are gove rned by the pupil\\'s background know ledge and experience, situation and\\nenvironment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the Socratic\\nmethod.[6]\\nThe meaning of the term \"pedagogy\"  is often contested and a great variety of definitions has been\\nsugge sted.[7] The most common approach is to define it as the study or science of teaching methods .[7][8] In\\nthis sense, it is the methodol ogy of education. As a methodol ogy, it investigates the ways and practices that\\ncan be used to realize the aims of education.[9][8][10] The main aim is often identified with the transmission\\nof know ledge. Other aims include fostering skills and character traits. They include helping the student\\ndevelop their intellectual and social abilities as well as psychomotor and affective learning, which are about\\ndeveloping pr actical skills and adequate emotional dispositions, respectively.[9][11][12]\\nHowever, not everyone  agrees with this characterization of pedagogy and some see it less as a science and\\nmore as an art or a craft.[7][13] This characterization puts more emphasis on the practical aspect of\\npedagogy , which may involve various forms of \"tacit know ledge that is hard to put into words\".

His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the\\nattainment of skilled judge ment rather than know ledge of rules.

Learning\\nspaces are highly diverse in use, learning styles, configuration, location, and educational institution.
